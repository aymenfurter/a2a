## Overview

This repository is a **technology demonstrator** showcasing the implementation of two protocols for AI agent collaboration: the **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

**What are these protocols?**
- The **A2A protocol** is an open standard hosted by the Linux Foundation that enables collaboration between AI agents across different platforms, vendors, and technologies
- The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs, acting like a universal connector between AI models and various data sources

**What this demonstration shows:**
This project illustrates how to build A2A-compliant agents using Microsoft's ecosystem - Azure AI Foundry, Copilot Studio and Semantic Kernel - while integrating external data sources through MCP. The result is a practical example of assembling a collaborative team of AI agents, each leveraging different Microsoft Cloud capabilities to work together on complex enterprise workflows.

Rather than building monolithic AI solutions, this approach demonstrates how specialized agents can be orchestrated to create a truly collaborative AI agent ecosystem where each agent contributes its unique strengths to solve complex business problems.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Coordinate multiple remote agents in a group chat.
- **Remote MCP Server** - Connect to external data sources through MCP protocol, with Confluence serving as an example.
- **User Story Formatting** - Transform raw requirements into well-structured Azure DevOps work items
- **UI** - Terminal-based interface for progress visualization
- **Modular Architecture** - Easy to extend with new agents and capabilities

### Group Chat Demo

![Demo](demo.gif)

The group chat orchestrator automatically:

1. **Extracts** todos from Confluence pages
2. **Formats** them into structured work items
3. **Creates** Azure DevOps work items

## Architecture

### Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Technology | Port |
|-------|---------|------------|------|
| **Confluence Agent** | Extract todos from Confluence pages | Azure OpenAI + MCP | 8002 |
| **Formatter Agent** | Structure work items with acceptance criteria | Copilot Studio | 8000 |
| **DevOps Agent** | Create Azure DevOps work items | Azure AI + Logic Apps | 8001 |

## Usage

### Start Individual Agents

```bash
cd confluence_agent && python main.py # for all agents
cd group_chat && python main.py # seperate terminal
```
